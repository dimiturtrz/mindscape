# Agent Instructions

This project uses **bd** (beads) for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` for full workflow context.

## Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work atomically
bd close <id>         # Complete work
bd dolt push          # Push beads data to remote
```

## Non-Interactive Shell Commands

**ALWAYS use non-interactive flags** with file operations to avoid hanging on confirmation prompts.

Shell commands like `cp`, `mv`, and `rm` may be aliased to include `-i` (interactive) mode on some systems, causing the agent to hang indefinitely waiting for y/n input.

**Use these forms instead:**
```bash
# Force overwrite without prompting
cp -f source dest           # NOT: cp source dest
mv -f source dest           # NOT: mv source dest
rm -f file                  # NOT: rm file

# For recursive operations
rm -rf directory            # NOT: rm -r directory
cp -rf source dest          # NOT: cp -r source dest
```

**Other commands that may prompt:**
- `scp` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` for non-interactive
- `ssh` - use `-o BatchMode=yes` to fail instead of prompting
- `apt-get` - use `-y` flag
- `brew` - use `HOMEBREW_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` env var

## Beads Issue Tracker

This project uses **bd (beads)** for issue tracking. Run `bd prime` to see full workflow context and commands.

### Quick Reference

```bash
bd ready              # Find available work
bd show <id>          # View issue details
bd update <id> --claim  # Claim work
bd close <id>         # Complete work
```

### Rules

- Use `bd` for ALL task tracking — do NOT use TodoWrite, TaskCreate, or markdown TODO lists
- Run `bd prime` for detailed command reference and session close protocol
- Use `bd remember` for persistent knowledge — do NOT use MEMORY.md files

## Session Completion

**When ending a work session**, you MUST complete ALL steps below. Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**

1. **File issues for remaining work** - Create issues for anything that needs follow-up
2. **Run quality gates** (if code changed) - Tests, linters, builds
3. **Update issue status** - Close finished work, update in-progress items
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE** - This is MANDATORY:
   ```bash
   git pull --rebase
   bd dolt push
   git push
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin"
   ```
5. **Clean up** - Clear stashes, prune remote branches
6. **Verify** - All changes committed AND pushed
7. **Hand off** - Provide context for next session

**CRITICAL RULES:**
- Work is NOT complete until `git push` succeeds
- NEVER stop before pushing - that leaves work stranded locally
- NEVER say "ready to push when you are" - YOU must push
- If push fails, resolve and retry until it succeeds

## Conventions & Patterns

### Code quality — ruff ratchet (bd mindscape-y63)

CI has an **enforced** lint gate (`ruff check core neuroscan baselines --select <graduated>`) that grows one
family per PR — fix-all-first, then graduate the family into the enforced `--select`. Plus **advisory** steps
(full curated backlog + `ruff format --check`). Config lives in `[tool.ruff]` (line-length 120). `N` (the
`X`/`y` tensor idiom) and `RUF001/002/003` (intentional `→ ≈ ×` unicode in docstrings) are deliberately not
selected. Working rules:

- **Bare `# noqa: CODE`** only — no prose (RUF100 enforces it suppresses a real hit). Prefer fixing.
- **Imports at top** — break circulars by extraction, never lazy imports.
- **Config objects, not param lists** — collapse too-many-args to a pydantic/dataclass config.
- **No blind `except`** — a specific exception, or let it crash.
- **Minimal comments** — self-documenting names.
- Keep **CLAUDE.md ↔ AGENTS.md in sync**.

### Architecture layers — import-linter contract (bd o92)

Three tiers, imports point **down only**: `core` (clean kernel) < `neuroscan` (trainer) < `neuroviz`
(viewer). Enforced statically in CI (`uvx --from import-linter lint-imports`, contracts in
`[tool.importlinter]`). What's forbidden is **upward drift**: `core` importing `neuroscan`/`neuroviz`, or
`neuroscan` importing `neuroviz`. The viewer reusing the trainer's model registry
(`neuroviz → neuroscan.models.get_method`) is an **intended downward edge** — allowed, not drift. Adding an
upward import breaks CI; if a layer genuinely needs a symbol from above, the symbol is in the wrong layer —
push it down (into `core`), don't invert the arrow.

### Architecture fitness — `graph.py --assert` gate (bd 3nn)

`devtools/graph.py` (bd 2r9/3nn, `[devtools]` extra) is both the **explorer** (`python -m devtools.graph` —
fan-in/out / bottleneck / betweenness / cycles via grimp+networkx) **and** a CI **fitness gate**
(`python -m devtools.graph --assert`) — the *metric* arch axis import-linter's categorical contracts can't
express. **Blocks** on a god-module (fan-in AND fan-out both > `bottleneck_degree`), an import cycle (SCC>1),
a god-file (> `file_max`), or a **test-mirror** gap: a logic module `<pkg>/<path>/foo.py` with no strict
path-mirror test at `tests/unit/<path>/test_foo.py` (one home per module — a same-purpose test under a
different name does not count; rename it to the mirror path). Coverage-**omitted** shells (runners/adapters/
GPU/download/viz glue) are exempt — a non-unit-testable shell has no meaningful mirror and forcing a stub
violates no-stubs, so the same "not logic" set the coverage gate omits is exempt here too (`unmirrored()`
reads `[tool.coverage] omit`). **Advisory** (logged, never blocks): line-floor + betweenness chokepoint. Thresholds
live in `[tool.structure]`, chosen clean against today's graph — they **ratchet only tighter, never relax**.
Runs in the CI `tests` job (needs the `[devtools]` extra).

### Module shape — ast-grep gate (bd ylq)

Semantic AST rules ruff's token linters can't express (`devtools/sgconfig.yml` → `devtools/sg-rules/`,
enforced in CI: `ast-grep scan -c devtools/sgconfig.yml core neuroscan`, severity `error` blocks). Two rules:
**`py-top-level-function`** — everything meaningful is a method: a top-level `def` must live on the class that
owns it (`main`/`_main` exempt). The whole `core`+`neuroscan` tree was migrated (269 free funcs → 0), so any
NEW top-level function fails CI. **`py-top-level-side-effect`** — no import-time call statements (move them into
a method / lazy-populate, as the registries do; `matplotlib.use()` exempt). Fix by refactoring, never a `# noqa`.
Constants, `logger`, dataclasses, pydantic models, enums, and `nn.Module`/`Dataset` subclasses stay top-level —
only plain `def`s move.

### Duplication — jscpd gate (bd apl)

`devtools/jscpd.json` (Node, run in CI + `nox -s dup`) — the DRY axis. **Blocks** when python duplication
exceeds 1% (currently 0.7% after the runner boilerplate was DRY-extracted into `Cli.setup_logging` +
`Riemann.cross_subject_decode`). Fix a regression by extracting the shared logic, not by raising the threshold —
it ratchets **down** as dup settles. Genuinely-distinct-but-similar-shaped runners are left un-merged (don't
over-couple to chase the number).

### Local gate runners — nox + pre-commit (bd kvo/dno)

`nox` (`noxfile.py`, `[devtools]` extra) reproduces the CI gate suite locally from one command: `nox` runs
`lint` (ruff+vulture+import-linter+ast-grep) + `test` (pytest+coverage floor) + `fitness` (graph.py --assert);
`nox -s dup` adds advisory jscpd. Sessions shell the SAME pinned tools CI uses, so local == CI.
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` runs the fast static gates (all but test/coverage) before each commit — enable with
`pre-commit install` (keep it separate from the beads `.beads/hooks/pre-commit`), or one-shot `pre-commit run
--all-files`.
